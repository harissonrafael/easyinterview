## Flows

Go to URL <http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui/>.

The `Candidate Entity`, `Interview Entity` and `Period Entity`
sessions have subsections to manage their respective entities. For `Candidate Entity`, `Interview Entity` sessions it is
possible to search, create, update and delete their respective entities, but in the `Period Entity` session it is only
possible to search. The others actions are not allowed and if executed, an error will be returned.

#### Describing subsections

- GET: retrieves a predefined number of records (also called record page). It is possible to set values for `page`
  , `size` and `sort` fields.
- POST: create a new record using json added in `Request body` text area.
- PUT: updates the record related to the passed id using json added in the `Request body` textarea.
- PATCH: update record specific fields related to passed id using json added in `Request body` textarea.
- DELETE: delete the record related to the passed id.

### Candidate

Examples to find, create, update and delete Candidate and their available times

> Note: To execute some action, just click on the desired subsection, on the `Try it out` button, fill in the required fields (when applicable) and press `Execute`;

#### Retrieve candidates (GET)

Just run what is in the note above. Another possibility is on the browser using
URL: <http://localhost:8080/api/candidates>

#### Create candidate (POST)

Just run what is in the note above using a json in `Request body` textarea. For example:

```
{
  "name": "Candidate 3",
  "slots": [
    {
      "dateTime": "2022-01-02T08:00:00"
    },
    {
      "dateTime": "2022-01-03T08:00:00"
    },
    {
      "dateTime": "2022-01-04T10:00:00"
    },
    {
      "dateTime": "2022-01-06T16:00:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Update candidate (PUT)

> Note: In this action, all entities passed by parameters will be updated.
> So if you are not setting the id then that entity will be removed and created next.
> To retrieve the complete object you can use the 'find by id' subsection to copy the entities with their respective ids

Just run what is in the note above using a json in `Request body` textarea.

For example (This example was copied from find by id subsection):

```
{
  "id": 3,
  "name": "Candidate 3",
  "slots": [
    {
      "id": 9,
      "dateTime": "2022-01-02T08:00:00",
      "candidateId": 3
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "dateTime": "2022-01-03T08:00:00",
      "candidateId": 3
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "dateTime": "2022-01-04T10:00:00",
      "candidateId": 3
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "dateTime": "2022-01-06T16:00:00",
